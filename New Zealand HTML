<h2>Introduction</h2>   
<p>Located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, New Zealand is a stunning country that should be right at the top of your travel list! It boasts a number of natural beauties- glaciers, rolling hills, national parks- as well as exciting metropolitan cities, surf hotspots and of course, Hobbiton! There's truly something for everyone! The rich Māori culture can be found all around the northern and southern parts of the island which only serve to enrich the country’s impressive history. With the friendliest locals around (known as Kiwis) and delicious food, you’re bound to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience there! </p>
    <main>
        <div id="What to See"></div>
        <h2>What To See</h2>
<p>Here are the top five places to visit in New Zealand:</p>
<p><strong>1. Bay of Islands-</strong> This is truly one of the best places to visit in the country. It is perfect for sailing, fishing and other watersports. With stunning views the bay is made up of 144 islands with perfect spots to enjoy a fresh lunch under the sun. We’d highly recommend that you try scuba diving there!</p>
<p><strong>2. Christchurch -</strong> For a big city there is plenty to see here, including the city’s great revival over the years. Lots of new buildings are made out of the old shipping containers including the ‘Cardboard Cathedral’. A top place to visit is the city’s botanical gardens.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hobbiton -</strong> If you’re a Lord of the Rings fan, then you’re in for a real treat! If not, you’ll still find this place super exciting. Hobbiton is a movie set which is situated on a family run farm. Enjoy a guided tour of the set with different hobbit holes to look into. Because it is a popular tourist attraction, bear in mind that it may be a little crowded at times, but overall it’s not to be missed! </p>
<p><strong>4. Te Puia - </strong>This fascinating arts and crafts institute is located in Rororua’s Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley, home to lots of active geysers and mud pools. It is a heritage center for Māori culture and history. Amongst all of the interesting experiences, you can receive an authentic “steambox” lunch using ancient cooking techniques.</p>
<p><strong>5. Aoraki Mount Cook National Park -</strong> Some of New Zealand’s highest mountains and longest glacier are found here. With great hiking paths, whatever your skill level you’ll enjoy walking in the fresh air with spectacular sights all around. There are opportunities to climb for any experienced climbers out there! </p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>There’s no denying that travelling isn’t quite the same without the great cuisines that you can taste along the way! New Zealand is not exception with its fab food! Here are the top five meals that we suggest you try:</p>
<p><strong>1. Hangi - </strong>If you’re a meat eater you’ll love this traditional Māori dish. It consists of slow-cooked meat and vegetables that is cooked in an underground oven. In traditional Māori culture, it is a special dish that is prepared on special occasions. </p>
<p><strong>2. Kiwi Burger-</strong> What’s not to like about a burger? It includes beetroot and a fried egg on top of the traditional burger patty- worth a try! </p>
<p><strong>3. Kina-</strong> Kiwis absolutely love their seafood. Kina is a sea urchin with a hard spiky outer shell and a deliciously fleshy inside. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it! </p>
<p><strong>4. Pavlova-</strong> Controversial but apparently it is a Kiwi sweet dish (not australian!) Made of meringue, fruit and whipped cream- this dessert will be the way to your heart! </p>
<p><strong>5. Hokey Pokey ice cream-</strong> As a cool and sweet refresher, be sure to taste this Kiwi favourite! It’s caramelized honeycomb which is bound to tantalize your taste buds!</p>

<div id="Transport">    
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>You’ll be relieved to know that it is super easy to get around New Zealand. Public transport is prominent in all cities and most towns. Buses operate quite regularly and both Auckland and Wellington have city-suburban rail services. </p>
<p>Public Transport: All New Zealand cities and most towns have buses, and Auckland and Wellington both have city-suburban rail services. Go to Our regions and cities section for more detail.</p>
<p>Cars: Renting a car is pretty easy, though buying a car will weirdly cost you less money. Most rental companies have depots in town where you can pick up your cars. Remember that everyone drives on the left in New Zealand! Before searching for a good company make sure to check NZTA’s advice on safety and mechanical conditions of cars.</p> 
<p>Taxis: If you don’t want to rent a car or use public transport, there are a number of taxi companies who can get you around places. Uber also operates- just download the Uber app and you’re read to go! </p>
<p>Planes: For longer trips, it is possible to fly. Between Auckland and Wellington a flight will usually take an hour, compared with eight hours of driving. The two main travel airlines are Air New Zealand and Jetstar and a few smaller regional operators. Check the timetables and fares online- usually the price of tickets aren’t too expensive.</p>

<div id="Where to stay">    
<h2>Where To Stay</h2>
<p>Depending on where you go in New Zealand there are plenty of great places to stay which are safe and full of friendly travelers and New Zealanders. The costs of rooms depends on the type of hostel or hostel and what extra features you would like, including how much privacy you’re hoping for.</p>

<div>
<div id="Language tips">    
<h2>Language Tips</h2>
<p>New Zealand has three official languages: English, Maori and New Zealand Sign Language. Maori is particularly interesting for it belongs to the indigenous Maāori people and it was made an official language by statue in 1987. The language can be used in official settings, like court. It is closely related to Tahitian and Cook Islands Māori. Since the 1970s, it has been revitalised in the New Zealand community and the number of speakers has grown considerably. </p>
<p>Fear not, you won’t be expected to speak all three official languages fluently. English can be used all around the island with absolute ease, since 91.6% of the population speak it and it has been the predominant language for a while. In terms of English pronunciation, New Zealanders are very close to their neighbours, the Australians! </p>
<p>Much like any English speakers, there comes a bit of local linho which will be handy to know on your holidays! A few examples are:</p>
<li>All good: That’s ok, never mind</li>
<li>Sweet as: Great, good, fine</li>
<li>Choice as: That’s great, awesome, sure</li>

<div id="Safety">    
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>By international standards, New Zealand is one of the safest countries in the world, especially for female solo travellers. In the 2017 international Global Peace Index, it was rated the world’s second safest country after Iceland, out of 126 countries. </p>
<p>However, as with any country it’s really important to stay safe and to not take any risks. Petty theft can be common in the country; wherever you go make sure to keep an eye on your possessions and look out for anyone who is acting suspiciously. Do not leave any valuables in cars as thieves tend to target vehicles. </p>
<p>In terms of natural disasters, earthquakes pose a substantial risk with large quakes happening at any time. Familiarise yourself with best practice during earthquakes. The same can be said for tsunamis; if one were to occur you should move to high ground immediately. Likewise, volcano eruptions are common; the last eruption took place on White Island in the Bay of Plenty on 9 December 2019- follow the advice of local authorities and notify official bodies (Department of Conservation) of your whereabouts if you’re rock climbing or hiking in a remote area. </p>
